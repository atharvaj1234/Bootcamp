# Object Copying Logic (Overcomes Object Shallowing)

## Purpose
This README explains the logic behind copying an expense object in JavaScript using the provided `copyObject` function in five steps.

## Steps

1. **Function Definition:**
   - Defines the `copyObject` function to create a deep copy of an object passed as an argument.

2. **Base Case Check:**
   - Ensures the object is not null and is of type 'object'. If it's either null or not an 'object', returns the value as it is.

3. **Recursive Copying:**
   - Initializes an empty `copy` object and recursively copies properties using a `for...in` loop.

4. **Copying Process:**
   - Copies properties from the original object to the `copy` object, handling nested objects and primitive values.

5. **Return Copy:**
   - Returns the `copy` object, creating a deep copy of the original object.

## Usage
To create a deep copy of an object, use the `copyObject` function, passing the object as an argument:


This ensures that modifications to copyOfExpense or the original expense object do not affect each other.
