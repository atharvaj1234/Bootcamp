# FadeIn Animation with Opacity and Transform-Translate

## Description
This project demonstrates a FadeIn animation effect using CSS `opacity` and `transform-translate` attributes. The animation is inspired by the Raw Engineering website and is implemented to create a smooth and elegant entrance for elements on the webpage.

## Animation Details
- **Effect**: FadeIn animation when elements enter the viewport.
- **CSS Properties**:
  - `opacity`: Transitioning from 0 to 1 for a gradual appearance.
  - `transform`: Applying `translateY` to move elements vertically.
- **Timing**:
  - Duration: 0.5 seconds for the fade-in effect.
  - Delay: 0.2 seconds to stagger the appearance of elements.
- **Trigger**:
  - Animation triggered when elements enter the viewport.

## Usage
   - Open index.html in a web browser.
   - Scroll down to see the FadeIn animation effect on the elements as they enter the viewport.

## Notes
   - Customization: Modify the transition properties and transform values for different effects.
   - Browser Compatibility: Tested the animation across various browsers.
   - Performance: Optimize animations for smooth performance, especially with multiple elements.

## Inspiration
   - The FadeIn animation was inspired by the animation effects on the Raw Engineering website.
