# CSS Positions and Animation

## Description
This repository contains two completed tasks demonstrating CSS positions and animations:

### Task 5: CSS Positions Layout
In this task, a layout was created to demonstrate CSS positions. A parent container was designed with four children boxes positioned in each corner and one at the center.
